The challenge for Week2 was to create a web application from scratch using our own portfolio as a basis with CSS.  We were given an image of the sample and the following critiria:
    Sections with our name, a recent photo, links to our work, and contact methods.
    Sections had to be interactive and links working,
    The image of the first application had to be larger
    when clicking on the images of the applications a working link had to be in place,
    When resizing he page to view in different screen sizes the viewpoint would have to be adaptive. 

** I must mention that since this is only our second week of class, we only have 1 completed application which is Run-Buddy.

In order to complete the work, we focused on using different dynamic aspects of CSS.  These include the following:
	Added a flexbox to the header,
	Added shadows to all headers, and the graph,
	Added media queries in order to be able to view site I different screens,
	Added a CSS grid
	Animated the hover

I hope you enjoy looking at it as much as I enjoyed working on it.
